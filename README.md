## DevNet Associate Certification - Training Repo.
This repo contains scripts and other examples of things I created and/or used when studying for the DevNet Associate certification exam. Feel free to use any of the example code. Be aware that not everything may work, as Cisco's sandbox credentials and/or URLs can change.   

Any API keys/tokens left in scripts are either temporary tokens or publicly available tokens for DevNet sandbox resources.
