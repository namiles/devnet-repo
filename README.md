# DevNet Associate Certification - Training Repo.
Repo for DevNet training. All scripts and other examples of things used when studying for the DevNet Associate certification exam. Feel free to use any of the example code. Be aware that not everything may work, as Cisco's sandbox credentials and/or URLs can change.   

Any API keys/tokens left in scripts are okay because they are either temporary tokens or publicly available tokens for DevNet sandbox resources.
